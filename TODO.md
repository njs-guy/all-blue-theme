# To do

## General

-   [x] Make classes and types the same color. (Yellow)
-   [x] Make CSS id's the function color.
-   [x] Minimap highlighting.
-   [ ] Finish markdown highlighting.
-   [ ] Make scrollbar transparent on hover.

## Default theme

-   [ ] Completely redo syntax colors. Still completely blue-ish but focus a little more on contrast. (At least within the possibility of maintaining the gimmick.)

## Calm

-   [x] Go for more pastel colors.
