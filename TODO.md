# To do

## General

- [ ] Finish markdown highlighting.

## v1.1

- [x] Generate json files from scripts
- [x] Rework selection highlighting
- [x] Change escape chars to function color
- [ ] JS Constants back to var color.
    - Maybe make it more consistent in the future.
With how it works now, the color changing for constants
is just confusing.
- [ ] Change variable.other.property to tag color.
- [ ] Terminal colors
- [ ] Color palette image for the docs.
