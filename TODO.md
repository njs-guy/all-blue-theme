# To do

## General

-   [ ] Make classes and types the same color. (Yellow)
-   [ ] Make CSS id's the function color.

## Default theme

-   [ ] Completely redo syntax colors. Still completely blue-ish but focus a little more on contrast. (At least within the possibility of maintaining the gimmick.)
