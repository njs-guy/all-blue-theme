# To do

## General

- [ ] Finish markdown highlighting.

## v1.1

- [x] Generate json files from scripts
- [x] Rework selection highlighting
- [x] Change escape chars to function color
- [x] JS Constants back to var color.
    - Maybe make it more consistent in the future.
With how it works now, the color changing for constants
is just confusing.
- [x] Change variable.other.property to tag color.
- [x] Change minimap find colors
- [x] Change scrollbar border colors and split view separators.
They look pretty out of place.
- [x] Maybe tweak Waves pink
- [ ] Maybe tweak Calm yellow
- [ ] Input validation colors
- [x] Keybinding labels
- [ ] Terminal colors
- [ ] Color palette image for the docs.
