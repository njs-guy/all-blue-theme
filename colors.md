## Syntax highlighting

All Blue has three syntax highlighting variants.
All Blue uses all blue-ish colors but that's
a gimmick not everyone's down with, so Waves and Calm use
other colors for better visibility. Waves uses brighter tropical colors
to give off an energetic, ocean feel. Calm uses lower saturation
pastel colors for more of a smooth sailing vibe.
